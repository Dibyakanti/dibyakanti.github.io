Hi, I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Manchester, under the joint supervision of [Prof. Anirbit Mukherjee](https://anirbit-ai.github.io) and [Prof. Alex Frangi](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/alejandro-frangi).

Prior to this, I completed my undergraduate studies from [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in) in 2022, with a major in Electronics and Electrical Engineering and a minor in Computer Science.

My primary research interests lie in advancing the theoretical understanding of deep learning algorithms. Additionally, I am deeply intrigued by the application of deep learning techniques to address and solve complex, physics-inspired problems.

Here is a link to my [CV](/assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
