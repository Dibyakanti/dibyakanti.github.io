Hi, I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Manchester, under the joint supervision of [Prof. Anirbit Mukherjee](https://anirbit-ai.github.io) and [Prof. Alex Frangi](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/alejandro-frangi). 

My primary interest is in improving the theoretical understanding of deep learning algorithms. I am also very interested in applying deep learning to solve physics-inspired problems.
